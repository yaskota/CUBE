# 💖 I Love You 3D Cube Animation 🚀  
*A rotating cube with a secret message, hover effects, and endless vibes – perfect for coders, lovers, and Gen Z chaos enthusiasts.*  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **360° Infinite Rotation**: Hypnotic spin powered by CSS/JS.  
- **Hover to Scale**: Outer cube grows on hover (because drama).  
- **Image Gallery Cube**: Each side displays custom images.  
- **"I Love You" Text**: Subtle? Nah. Bold? Always. 💌  
- **Responsive Design**: Works on screens *and* hearts.

🎮 Usage  
- **Hover**: Outer cube scales up (hover harder for ✨effect✨).  
- **Rotate Forever**: Cube spins infinitely (like my thoughts at 3 AM).  
- **Customize**: Replace side images, tweak colors, or change the message to "I Love Code".  

*Pro Tip: Send the live link to your crush and say, "This cube runs smoother than my rizz."*
